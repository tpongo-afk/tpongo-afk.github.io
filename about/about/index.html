Climate change / global warming / sustainability
Global warming is one of the many big global issues that I care about. It is caused by the atmosphere warming effect of
green house gases (carbon-dioxide, methane and other gases) released in excess by human activities (burning fossil
fuels, raising cows, etc&hellip;). Apart from the large scientific consensus on the
existence of human-caused climate change, I also have some anecdotal observations from my memories. One of which is
the amount of snow we had in Hungary in the winters of 2000s when I was a kid vs how much we have nowadays. Needless to
say, there was much more snow back then, I have memories of building snowmen and playing in the snow basically every
year. A more recent event was the 2024 heat wave during the summer in Hungary which took like a month, something like
which I have not experienced such before. This event was proven to be intensified by climate
change." />

<h2 id="climate-change--global-warming--sustainability">Climate change / global warming / sustainability</h2>
<p>Global warming is one of the many big global issues that I care about. It is caused by the atmosphere warming effect of
green house gases (carbon-dioxide, methane and other gases) released in excess by human activities (burning fossil
fuels, raising cows, etc&hellip;). Apart from the large scientific consensus on the
existence of human-caused climate change, I also have some anecdotal observations from my memories. One of which is
the amount of snow we had in Hungary in the winters of 2000s when I was a kid vs how much we have nowadays. Needless to
say, there was much more snow back then, I have memories of building snowmen and playing in the snow basically every
year. A more recent event was the 2024 heat wave during the summer in Hungary which took like a month, something like
which I have not experienced such before. This event was <a href="https://earth.org/death-toll-of-european-heatwave-3-times-higher-because-of-climate-change-analysis-shows/">proven</a> to be intensified by climate
change.</p>
<p>Personally, I think that there won&rsquo;t be a doomsday but rather the climate will kill us in a stochastic way, i.e. more
floods, more heatwaves, more radical weather events will cause increasing deaths and the extinction of species. Food
shortages will also be &ldquo;only&rdquo; apparent in the increase of prices (based on basic supply and demand law). Due to extreme
events, insurances will cost more. Overall it will cost us money, lives and natural scenery. Rich people will nearly not
notice it but will be quite bad for poorer people.</p>
<p>The solution to global warming is manifold, we can do against it on a personal, institutional and governmental level.
There are many articles online detailing the possible ways to reduce our
climate impact e.g. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Individual_action_on_climate_change">Wikipedia</a>.</p>
<h2 id="open-source-software-open-access-in-science">Open Source Software, open access in science</h2>
<p>I admire the idea of open-source software. There are many great examples of this, such as linux, numpy, ffmpeg, most
programs on linux, etc.</p>
<p>Open access in science should be standard but even today many articles and books are behind paywalls, even though
probably most of the research were funded by public money.</p>
<h2 id="minimalism">Minimalism</h2>
<p>I am a minimalist as in not owing too many things (although this is relative), and not wanting to own much more.
I aim to gain joy in life not through the consumption of goods but rather by enjoying the company of family, friends,
colleagues, having a meaningful job and spending time in nature.</p>
<h2 id="anti-capitalism">Anti capitalism</h2>
<p>There are definitely positive things about capitalism but in my opinion there are many more on the negative side.
One core idea of capitalism is that competition lowers prices and ensures better products, thus better for consumers.
This is the theory but many times large corporations tend towards monopolization buying up competition.
Lobbying also undermines democracy. In order to have higher profits, companies enshittify their products.
Another common arguments for capitalism is that this is the most optimal way of distributing resources.
As if there was an existing demand for getting addicted to social media or all those cheap mostly plastic items which
end up in the landfill shortly after the buy date.</p>
<h2 id="reuse-repair-recycle">Reuse, repair, recycle</h2>
<p>This one relates to sustainability and minimalism too. Why buy disposable plastic bottles or other products when you
have reusable alternative? Why throw away a piece of torn clothing or faulty electronics when it could be fixed? Why buy
new products when many times used items are a good alternative? All these things can also decrease one&rsquo;s environmental
footprint. I don&rsquo;t claim that I do all of these perfectly but it is something to strive for.</p>
