      <description>&lt;p&gt;I am Tivadar Pong√≥. Here I will write about values I live by and problems I care about in the world.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;climate-change--global-warming--sustainability&#34;&gt;Climate change / global warming / sustainability&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Global warming is one of the many big global issues that I care about. It is caused by the atmosphere warming effect of&#xA;green house gases (carbon-dioxide, methane and other gases) released in excess by human activities (burning fossil&#xA;fuels, raising cows, etc&amp;hellip;). Apart from the large scientific consensus on the&#xA;existence of human-caused climate change, I also have some anecdotal observations from my memories. One of which is&#xA;the amount of snow we had in Hungary in the winters of 2000s when I was a kid vs how much we have nowadays. Needless to&#xA;say, there was much more snow back then, I have memories of building snowmen and playing in the snow basically every&#xA;year. A more recent event was the 2024 heat wave during the summer in Hungary which took like a month, something like&#xA;which I have not experienced such before. This event was &lt;a href=&#34;https://earth.org/death-toll-of-european-heatwave-3-times-higher-because-of-climate-change-analysis-shows/&#34;&gt;proven&lt;/a&gt; to be intensified by climate&#xA;change.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
